summary: "Silicon extracted from smelting slag, fabricated into 28nm TPUs. Each module delivers supercomputer-scale AI compute — equivalent to 26 Frontier systems."

There is no need to chase cutting-edge 3nm. The 28nm node is the most capable process reachable without EUV lithography, and it can be sustained entirely in space.

What the node lacks in density, sheer volume compensates. Power is virtually unlimited, vacuum serves as a free cleanroom, and microgravity grows uniform ingots. When a single module devotes 111 MW to AI compute, that equals 26 Frontier supercomputers.
