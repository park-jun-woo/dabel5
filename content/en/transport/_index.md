summary: "From 1986 DA to EML5, from EML5 to SEL5. Orbital mechanics, NTP propulsion, solar sails, and transfer-window logistics."
---

A logistics network linking four nodes. EML5 (Earth-Moon L5) is 1.3 light-seconds from Earth; SEL5 (Sun-Earth L5) is 8 minutes 20 seconds away.

Ore mined from the asteroid is shipped at minimum delta-v, timed to orbital transfer windows. Heavy cargo moves by NTP; light cargo rides solar sails. On arrival, the ore goes straight into mirror-heated smelting.
