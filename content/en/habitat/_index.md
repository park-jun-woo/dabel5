summary: "O'Neill cylinder habitat modules. Rotational artificial gravity, closed-loop ecology, silicate-slag radiation shielding. Roughly 3,000 residents per module."
---

The habitat section of a Dyson module is a rotating O'Neill-type cylinder. Centrifugal force provides artificial gravity, and a 1 m thick layer of silicate slag — a smelting byproduct — shields against cosmic radiation.

At the bottom of the thermal cascade, 100-200°C waste heat supplies heating and hot water for free. Air and water circulate through a closed-loop life-support system.
