summary: "Thin Fe-Ni shielding panels — stamped by the same Dyson mirror factory — placed at SEL1 can directly control Earth's climate."

A Dyson swarm is not just for space civilization. The same factory that produces mirrors can stamp ultra-thin Fe-Ni shielding panels and deploy them at the Sun-Earth L1 point (SEL1), precisely regulating the solar radiation reaching Earth.

Two million km² of panel area is enough to cool the planet by 2°C. Nothing is sprayed into the atmosphere, the effect is fully reversible, and there are no side effects. Climate control is a byproduct of the Dyson swarm.
