summary: "A 1 km² mirror collects 1.2 GW of sunlight and a turbine converts it into 370 MW of electricity. Solar-thermal turbines, thermal cascade, and local consumption strategy."

The energy system of a Dyson module. Mirrors concentrate sunlight to spin turbines and generate electricity. The waste heat then cascades through four temperature stages — 1,600°C to 600°C to 200°C to 30°C — feeding smelting, manufacturing, habitation, and data centers in sequence.

Energy is consumed where it is produced. Instead of transmitting power across millions of kilometers and absorbing the losses, the factory is built right next to the mirror and connected by cable.
