summary: "A self-replicating Dyson swarm from asteroid resources at L5 — an engineering roadmap within the laws of physics."
tagline: "A Dyson swarm starting from asteroids"
description: "Never violates the laws of physics. All technology already exists."

why_title: "① Why? — The first step to a Dyson swarm isn't Mercury — it's asteroids and L5"
why_lead: "Dismantling Mercury is science fiction. Asteroid resources + an L5 foothold is the realistic first step within the laws of physics."
why_flow: ["Asteroid Mining", "Vacuum Smelting", "Mirror Fabrication", "Self-Replication", "Climate Stabilization"]
why_quote: "Shaving Mercury is science fiction. Mining asteroids is engineering."
