summary: "Vacuum-smelt asteroid ore and turn the slag into semiconductors. Mirror frames, turbines, batteries, 28nm TPUs — a self-sustaining manufacturing loop in space."

The vacuum of space is free refining equipment. Melt asteroid ore with concentrated mirror heat and impurities boil off by vapor-pressure difference, leaving ultra-pure Fe-Ni alloy behind.

Even the silicate slag is not wasted. Silicon is extracted from SiO₂ and fabricated into TPU chips at 28nm. The brain of the AI comes from smelting waste.
